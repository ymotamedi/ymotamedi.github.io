  My research focuses on how human culture and cognition interact in language evolution and development,
  using a multimodal approach that takes in the account the role of the body in language. 
  
  <br><br>
 I completed my PhD in the <a href = "https://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/" target = "_blank">Centre for Language Evolution</a> at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith and Marieke Schouwstra. During my PhD, I developed Artificial Sign Language Learning methodologies to investigate cultural evolution in manual communication systems.<br>
  Following my PhD, I held a short-term research post at the the <a href = "http://www.mpi.nl" target = "_blank">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a>,
  before arriving at UCL to work as a postdoc in the <a href = "https://www.language-cognition-lab.org/" target = "_blank">Language and Cognition Lab</a>, headed by Prof. Gabriella Vigliocco. looking at the role of multimodal iconicity in child language development.
  I am working with both experimental and naturalistic data to investigate the role of multimodal iconicity in child language development.<br>
