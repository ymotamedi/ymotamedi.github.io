  My research focuses on how children and adults learn and use language, and how languages evolve in response to the biases we bring to bear during interaction and learning. In particular,
  I am interested in how our ability to communicate through different modalities (i.e. speech, gesture, facial expressions) can facilitate learning and affect the types of linguistic structures we use.
  I use both experimental and observational data in my research, including online experiments, corpus analysis and secondary data analysis to answer questions about human behaviour.
  
  Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href = "http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/" target="blank">Centre for Language Evolution</a> at the University of Edinburgh.

  When I'm not doing research, I enjoy swimming, sewing and making <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MJWCjvbpGokrPLQP9" target = "blank">tiny cakes</a>.
