  My research focuses on how human culture and cognition interact in language evolution and development,
  using a multimodal approach that takes in the account the role of the body in language. 
  I completed my PhD in the <a href = "https://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/" target = "_blank">Centre for Language Evolution</a> 
  at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith and Marieke Schouwstra. 
  During my PhD, I developed Artificial Sign Language Learning methodologies to investigate the cultural 
  evolution of manual communication systems, modelling the evolution of sign language structure.
  Following my PhD, I held a short-term research post at the the 
  <a href = "http://www.mpi.nl" target = "_blank">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a>,
  before arriving at UCL to work as a postdoc in the
  <a href = "https://www.language-cognition-lab.org/" target = "_blank">Language and Cognition Lab</a>, 
  headed by Prof. Gabriella Vigliocco.
  My current work uses both experimental and naturalistic data to investigate the role of multimodal iconicity in 
  child language development.
