  I am a quantitative researcher with expertise in human communication, language development, and working with rich, multimodal data. I currently work as a data scientist for UserTesting, a video platform for customer experience testing.<br><br>
  
  I previously worked as an academic researcher, where my research focussed on how children and adults learn and use language, and how languages evolve in response to the biases we bring to bear during interaction and learning. In particular,
  I am interested in how our ability to communicate through different modalities (i.e. speech, gesture, facial expressions) can facilitate learning and affect the types of linguistic structures we use.
  I have used both experimental and observational data in my research, including online experiments, corpus analysis and secondary data analysis to answer questions about human behaviour.

  When I'm not doing research, I enjoy swimming, sewing and making <a href="/itsatinycake.html" target = "blank">tiny cakes</a>.
