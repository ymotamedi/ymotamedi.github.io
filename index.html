  I am a PhD candidate in the <a href = "http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/" target = "_blank">Centre for Language Evolution</a> at the University of Edinburgh,
  supervised by Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith and Marieke Schouwstra.
  <br><br>
  I received my MA (Hons) in French and English Language and my MSc in the Evolution of Language and Cognition from the University of Edinburgh.
 <br><br> 
  In January, I will begin a visiting postdoc position at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics,
  in the Language Evolution and Interaction Scholars of Nijmegen (LEvInSON) group, on a project entitled <i>Modality-specific effects in artificial
  language learning experiments: measuring iconicity in silent gesture experiments</i>.
  
  <br><br>
In my research, I use the manual modality to investigate how linguistic structure evolves through cultural evolutionary processes, 
  namely interaction between language users and transmission to new language users. 
  I use silent gesture experiments (where hearing participants communicate using only gesture) 
  to study how language-like structure emerges in manual communication.
  I am also interested in modality effects in emerging sign systems (e.g. iconicity) and how we can measure these effects in silent gesture experiments.
